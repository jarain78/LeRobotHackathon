## 🛠️ Gripper Description

### 🔧 General Structure

- Composed of **two synchronized jaws** that open and close in parallel.
- Built with **3D printed or machined parts**, designed with triangular geometries to reduce weight and preserve strength.
- Includes a **motor mount** at the rear for housing the actuator (e.g., NEMA motor).

### ⚙️ Motion System

- Incorporates **two horizontal guide rods** (top and bottom) for maintaining parallelism during motion.
- Movement is transmitted through a **linkage system** connecting the jaws to a central mechanism.
- The driving force is likely supplied via a **worm gear, cam, or eccentric rotary system**.

### 🔩 Assembly and Mounting

- CAD design includes **degrees of freedom constraints**, represented with standard DoF symbols (used in Onshape/SolidWorks).
- A **rigid rear plate** ensures proper alignment and solid structural support during operation.

### 📦 Potential Applications

- Handling **small to medium-sized objects** in structured environments.
- Integration with **robotic platforms** such as the SO-100 for education, research, or prototyping.
- Potential use in **medical tasks** (e.g., robotic auscultation) when adapted to hold specialized instruments like stethoscopes.
